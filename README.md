## About
Busey Ipsum was a side project of mine in 20012. I made it in 3 days on a PHP/MySQL CMS I was using to make websites at the time called Concrete5. It was pretty inflexible and the UX was horrible. Now that I'm a bit deeper in my career and am starting to focus more on design, I wanted to take another crack at it, improve the UX and see if I could write it in a way in that it could be statically hosted it on GitHub. My JS skills have never been the best, but this was fun to finally sit down and do. I once had grandiose ideas of putting it on Angular (was learning a bit about it at work), but quickly realized that would have been overkill. The whole processor is about 40 lines of Javascript.
